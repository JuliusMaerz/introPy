# Python essentials
In this week, we will cover the essentials of Python. On Monday, the lecture will discuss the differences between Python and R and their relative (dis)advantages. The following tutorial will introduce you to the basics of Python, the concept of object-oriented programming, and plotting using the package [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). On Wednesday, the lecture will discuss the Python in the context of data analysis. In the following tutorial, you will work with the data analysis packages *pandas* and *numpy*.

## Tutorials
This week, there are six tutorials. Start Jupyterhub using one of the buttons below (the UvA one only works for UvA students enrolled in the course):

### Monday tutorials
On Monday, there are three relatively short tutorials. You probably will not finish them all today; just make sure you finished all of them before Wednesday. The tutorials for today are written in Jupyter notebooks. Please do them in order (start with `0_introduction.ipynb`, then do `1_python_basics.ipynb`).

## Wednesday tutorials
On Wednesday, there are three tutorials on the data visualization package *matplotlib* (`2_matplotlib.ipynb`) and the data processing/analysis packages *pandas* (`3_pandas.ipynb`) and *numpy* (`4_numpy.ipynb`). The *numpy* tutorial is **optional** (i.e., its contents won't be featured on the exam/assignments), but highly recommended for those wanting to develop more advanced data analysis skills (which are useful for, e.g., machine learning and neuroimaging research).
