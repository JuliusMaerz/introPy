# Information for educators
All material from this course (except for the assignments, see below) is open-source and available under the [BSD 3-clause license](https://github.com/lukassnoek/introPy/blob/master/LICENSE). This allows redistribution and use, with or without modification, as long as proper attribution is given (see below). We would love it when others would use this material!

## Assignments
Although all tutorials are publicly available in the course's [Github repository](https://github.com/lukassnoek/introPy), we do not publish the course's assignments as this would enable students to start working on them before they are allowed to do so (and to share the answers). There are two assignments: one Jupyter notebook with several graded exercises testing the students' Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib skills (week 1) and one extensive description of a PsychoPy experiment students have to implement using the PsychoPy Coder interface (week 2).

If you'd like to get access to these assignments, please send Lukas an email (his email address can be found on his [website](https://lukas-snoek.com/)).
