# Assignment week 2
For this assignment, you have to program a *change detection* task to test participants' visual working memory. This task consists of a set of trials in which the participant briefly sees a stimulus (usually a set of gratings, slanted lines, or shapes), which after a short delay reappears in the exact same configuration or slightly differently (e.g., one of the lines changed orientation). After the stimulus reappears, the participant then has to respond whether the stimulus changed or not. The idea, here, is that the participant needs to keep the stimulus in *visual working memory* to be able to perform the task. Often, the complexity of the stimulus, sometimes called *set size*, (e.g., the number of lines/shapes presented at each trial) is varied in order to manipulate the working memory load.

* Doesn't matter which timing method you use (wait/clock-based/frame-based)
