This website contains information about the two-week Python & Psychopy course taught at the Research Master Psychology (University of Amsterdam). The material itself is hosted on Github in this repository . Prerequisites As this two-week Python course is preceded by a two-week R course in the Research Master Psychology, we assume that students are familiar with basic programming concepts (such as variables, conditionals, loops, and functions). Familiarity with Python is not necessary. Those that already have some experience with Python, however, may find this course (too) easy. To challenge those students, we included several more difficult (optional) exercises in the tutorials! Overview In week 1, you will learn the basics of Python. We assume that you have some programming experience in other languages (e.g., Matlab or R). In week 2, you will learn about the Python package Psychopy , which you can use to program experiments. The preliminary program can be found below. Week Day Format Topic 1 Mo. Lecture Introduction to Python 1 Mo. Tutorial Python essentials 1 We. Lecture Working with data 1 We.

Python For this course, we of course need a working installation of Python. There are two options: you download Python yourself (see below) or you use an online environment preconfigured with a working Python installlation. Online access to Python For students of the Research Master Psychology, we have set up an external server with Python (through Jupyterhub , which is explained here ) which can be used to do the tutorials; so no need to download Python yourself. The course's Canvas page outlines how to access the server. Alternatively, you may use Binder , which is a service that provides an online Python environment with the course's materials. You can take a look at our own Jupyterhub instance or a Binder-run instance by clicking on the buttons below. Note that our own Jupyterhub instance is only accessible to students from the Research Master Psychology who are enrolled in the \"Programming for Psychology\" course. Note that you must be connected to UvA VPN to be able to access the UvA server. In the online environment, you'll see a lot of files. The course material is stored in the tutorials folder. The solutions folder contains the same material, but with solutions to the exercises in the tutorials. You can ignore the rest of the files (which have to do with configuration and the contents of this website). Warning Note that Binder does not save your notebooks! After you quit Binder (or it times out after an hour of inactivity), all progress is lost (but you can download your notebooks/files). Our own Jupyterhub does save the files. More information on how to get started with the tutorials, go to the week 1 page . Installing Python on your own computer If you want to install Python on your own computer, we highly recommend you install Python through the Anaconda distribution . Choose the appropriate installer (Windows, Mac, or Linux; both the graphical and command line options are fine) and follow the installation instructions. After you have installed your own Python distribution, you can check whether it is working correctly by opening a terminal (on Mac/Linux) or Anaconda Prompt (on Window) and running the following: python -c \"import sys; print(sys.executable)\" This command should print out the location where you installed Python, e.g., /Users/your_name/anaconda3/bin/python (on Mac) or C:\\Users\\your_name\\anaconda3\\bin\\python (on Windows). Psychopy In the second week of the course, we are going to use the Python package psychopy to create simple experiments. If you have a working version of Python already, psychopy can be installed as a regular third-party package through pip . However, because psychopy interacts with a lot of (non-Python) programs and components, getting psychopy to work properly is all but trivial. Instead, we highly recommend installing the \"standalone\" version of psychopy . This version contains everything you need to create experiments using psychopy (even a custom Python distribution specifically designed for psychopy )! Note Note that psychopy does not work on remote servers (including our own and Binder/colab instances), so students from the Research Master course should also download the standalone psychopy version . To test whether the installation was successful and everything works as expected do the following: Start Psychopy; In the menu, click \"Demos\", \"Unpack demos\", and select a location to unpack the demo experiment files; Click on \"Demos\" again and then on \"stroop\", which should open stroop.psyexp in the PsychoPy Builder; Click on the green \"play\" button (\"run experiment\"); After a couple of seconds, you should see a pop-up prompting for a \"session\" and \"participant number\"; Fill in some number (e.g., 01) and click on \"Ok\" to start the experiment; Your screen should turn black and start the experiment! Downloading the material We use both Jupyter notebooks and regular Python scripts for our tutorials. The materials are stored on Github and can be downloaded as a zip-file by clicking on the button below: Download materials After downloading the materials, please unzip the folder. Note that students from the Research Master course do not need the materials from week 1 (which are already on the server). Warning If you work with your own Python installation, you may need to install additional Python packages. To do so, open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the downloaded materials and run the following: pip install . This is not necessary if you use Binder/Colab as your Python platform!

This project includes several nifty tools to make programming a little easier! Jupyterhub One tool that we use in this course is \"Jupyterhub\". This piece of software allows you to easily create a preconfigured Python environment on an external server \u2014 no need to install Python on your own computer anymore! You just go to the website/public IP associated with the external server and you can start programming! We run Jupyterlab on our own server at the University of Amsterdam, which Research Master students can use for this course. Others may use the aforementioned tool \"Binder\" to create a Jupyterhub instance themselves, which can be used for this course as well! Jupyterlab Another tool we use is \"Jupyterlab\", which is an extensive integrated development environment (IDE) similar to RStudio. Because it is implemented in the browser, it combines well with Jupyterhub (but it can also be used on your own computer). Using the Jupyterlab interface, you can create text files and (Python) scripts, open interactive Python consoles, open terminals, and run so-called Jupyter notebooks (for more info, check the documentation ). Don't worry if this doesn't make sense to you at this point! We will explain the most important functionality step-by-step during the course. If you want to see how Jupyterlab looks like, click one of the two buttons below, which will launch a Jupyterhub instance with a Jupyterlab interface that includes the course materials. The UvA Jupyterhub is only accessible to Research Master Students enrolled in the \"Programming for Psychology\" course. Note that, instead of using the Jupyterlab interface, you can also use the \"classic\" interface, which is less extensive but also \"cleaner\". To do so, click on Help \u2192 Launch Classic Notebook or change the word lab to the word tree in the URL. To change back from the classic interface to the Jupyterlab interface, change the word lab back to tree in the URL. Info If you have installed Python on your own computer, you can start the Jupyterlab interface by clicking on the JupyterLab icon in Anaconda Navigator (Mac/Windows) or running the following command in your terminal (Mac/Linux) or Anaconda prompt (Windows): jupyter lab Jupyter notebooks Finally, we use \"Jupyter notebooks\" a lot in this course. Jupyter notebooks are very similar to R Markdown files. Like R Markdown files, you can mix text, code, plots, and mathematical formulas within a single document. Most of our tutorials are actually written in Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks are great for \"interactive programming\", in which it is easy to experiment, try out, and troubleshoot your code. Because this mode of programming is great for teaching, we will use Jupyter notebooks a lot in week 1. Interactive programing is not, however, the only way in which you use Python. In fact, a lot of people use Python in a non-interactive way by writing scripts. In this \"script mode\" (for lack of a better term), writing the code and running the code are done separately. The code interface of Psychopy, for example, cannot be used interactively and only supports \"script mode\". We will dicuss both \"modes\" in this course. If you want to check out Jupyter notebooks already, open Jupyterlab (using Binder, on the UvA server, or on your own computer) and click in the launcher on the \"Python 3\" tile under the \"Notebook\" header, which will open a new Jupyter notebook!
