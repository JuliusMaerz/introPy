This website contains information about the two-week Python & Psychopy course taught at the Research Master Psychology (University of Amsterdam). The material itself is hosted on Github in this repository . Prerequisites As this two-week Python course is preceded by a two-week R course in the Research Master Psychology, we assume that students are familiar with basic programming concepts (such as variables, conditionals, loops, and functions). Familiarity with Python is not necessary. Overview In week 1, you will learn the basics of Python. We assume that you have some programming experience in other languages (e.g., Matlab or R). In week 2, you will learn about the Python package Psychopy , which you can use to program experiments. The preliminary program can be found below. Week Day Lecture/tutorial Topic 1 Mo. Lecture Introduction to Python 1 Mo. Tutorial Python basics + plotting 1 We. Lecture Working with data 1 We. Tutorial Pandas + Numpy 1 Fr. Exam All of the above 2 Mo. Lecture Introduction to stimulus presentation 2 Mo. Tutorial Psychopy Builder 2 We. Lecture Introduction to Psychopy coder 2 We. Tutorial Psychopy Coder 2 Fr. Assignment Create a simple Psychopy experiment! Learning goals At the end of this course, you will ... ... know the major differences between Python and R; ... know the (dis)advantages of Python relative to other programming languages; ... understand the concept of \"object-oriented programming\"; ... be able to create basic Python scripts; ... be able to implement basic data processing operations and visualizations using Matplotlib and Pandas (and, optionally, Numpy) ... know the basics of stimulus presentation; ... be able to implement simple experiments using the Psychopy builder and coder interface Getting started Go to the Installation page for installation instructions!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-intropy","text":"This website contains information about the two-week Python & Psychopy course taught at the Research Master Psychology (University of Amsterdam).

Python For this course, we of course need a working installation of Python. For students of the Research Master Psychology, we have set up an external server with a working version of Python (through Jupyterhub) which can be used to do the tutorials; so no need to download Python yourself. The course's Canvas page outlines how to access the server. Alternatively, you can follow the tutorials from the course using either an online Python environement (e.g., binder or Google Colab ) or your own Python installation. In case of the latter, we highly recommend you install Python through the Anaconda distribution . Choose the appropriate installer (Windows, Mac, or Linux; both the graphical and command line options are fine) and follow the installation instructions. Psychopy In the second week of the course, we are going to use the Python package psychopy to create simple experiments. If you have a working version of Python already, psychopy can be installed as a regular third-party package through pip . However, because psychopy interacts with a lot of (non-Python) programs and components, getting psychopy to work properly is all but trivial. Instead, we highly recommend installing the \"standalone\" version of psychopy . This version contains everything you need to create experiments using psychopy (even a custom Python distribution specifically designed for psychopy )! Note that psychopy does not work on remote servers (including our own), so students from the Research Master course should also download the standalone psychopy version . Downloading the material We use both Jupyter notebooks and regular Python scripts for our tutorials. The materials are stored on Github and can be downloaded as a zip-file by clicking on the button below: Download materials {: .md-button } After downloading the materials, please unzip the folder.
