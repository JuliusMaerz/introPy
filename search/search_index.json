Python For this course, we of course need a working installation of Python. There are two options: you download Python yourself (see below) or you use an online environment preconfigured with a working Python installlation. Online access to Python For students of the Research Master Psychology, we have set up an external server with Python (through Jupyterhub , which is explained here ) which can be used to do the tutorials; so no need to download Python yourself. The course's Canvas page outlines how to access the server. Alternatively, you may use Binder , which is a service that provides an online Python environment with the course's materials. You can take a look at our own Jupyterhub instance or a Binder-run instance by clicking on the buttons below. Note that our own Jupyterhub instance is only accessible to students from the Research Master Psychology who are enrolled in the \"Programming for Psychology\" course. Note that you must be connected to UvA VPN to be able to access the UvA server. In the online environment, you'll see a lot of files. The course material is stored in the tutorials folder. The solutions folder contains the same material, but with solutions to the exercises in the tutorials. You can ignore the rest of the files (which have to do with configuration and the contents of this website). Warning Note that Binder does not save your notebooks! After you quit Binder (or it times out after an hour of inactivity), all progress is lost (but you can download your notebooks/files). Our own Jupyterhub does save the files. More information on how to get started with the tutorials, go to the week 1 page . Installing Python on your own computer If you want to install Python on your own computer, we highly recommend you install Python through the Anaconda distribution . Choose the appropriate installer (Windows, Mac, or Linux; both the graphical and command line options are fine) and follow the installation instructions. After you have installed your own Python distribution, you can check whether it is working correctly by opening a terminal (on Mac/Linux) or Anaconda Prompt (on Window) and running the following: python -c \"import sys; print(sys.executable)\" This command should print out the location where you installed Python, e.g., /Users/your_name/anaconda3/bin/python (on Mac) or C:\\Users\\your_name\\anaconda3\\bin\\python (on Windows). PsychoPy In the second week of the course, we are going to use the Python package PsychoPy to create simple experiments. If you have a working version of Python already, psychopy can be installed as a regular third-party package through pip . However, because PsychoPy interacts with a lot of (non-Python) programs and components, getting PsychoPy to work properly is all but trivial. Instead, we highly recommend installing the \"standalone\" version of PsychoPy . This version contains everything you need to create experiments using PsychoPy (even a custom Python distribution specifically designed for PsychoPy)! Note Note that PsychoPy does not work on remote servers (including our own and Binder/colab instances), so students from the Research Master course should also download the standalone PsychoPy version . To test whether the installation was successful and everything works as expected do the following: Start PsychoPy; In the menu, click \"Demos\", \"Unpack demos\", and select a location to unpack the demo experiment files; Click on \"Demos\" again and then on \"stroop\", which should open stroop.psyexp in the PsychoPy Builder; Click on the green \"play\" button (\"run experiment\"); After a couple of seconds, you should see a pop-up prompting for a \"session\" and \"participant number\"; Fill in some number (e.g., 01) and click on \"Ok\" to start the experiment; Your screen should turn black and start the experiment! Downloading the material We use both Jupyter notebooks and regular Python scripts for our tutorials. The materials are stored on Github and can be downloaded as a zip-file by clicking on the button below: Download materials After downloading the materials, please unzip the folder. Note that students from the Research Master course do not need the materials from week 1 (which are already on the server). Warning If you work with your own Python installation, you may need to install additional Python packages. To do so, open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the downloaded materials and run the following: pip install . This is not necessary if you use Binder/Colab as your Python platform!

Before we will explain how to use it, please read the overview on the PsychoPy website. Now, let's familiarize ourselves with PsychoPy. Let's start by opening PsychoPy! After opening, you'll see a \"Tip of the Day\" pop-up; you may ignore that for now and close it. Warning On Mac, PsychoPy might not open right after starting it. In that case, clicking on the icon again seems to work. Subwindows Psychopy by default opens three subwindows: the PsychoPy Builder , the PsychoPy Coder , and the Experiment runner . The Builder is the graphical interface of PsychoPy, which you can use to create experiments without any code, whereas the Coder interface provides an editor in which you can program experiments using Python code (as provided by the PsychoPy package). The Experiment runner is a tool to create complex sets of experiments/tasks (e.g., a battery of different tasks or questionnaires). It also provides a \"log\" of whatever is happening in your experiment when you run it. In this tutorial, we will only discuss some general PsychoPy features, for which the Builder interface suffices, so you may close the Coder interface and the Experiment runner for now. To read more about the different interfaces, read the Getting started page on the PsychoPy website. Running an experiment To get an idea what a PsychoPy experiment may look like, let's run a demo! We created a super simple demo that showcases some of the functionality of PsychoPy, which can be found in the materials: tutorials/week_2/intropy_demo.psyexp . In the next tutorial, we are going to discuss this in more detail. For now, run the demo by doing the following: Open the intropy_demo.psyexp file (File &rarr Open); Then, click the large green \"play\" button (\u25ba) to start the experiment; This will open the Experiment runner and, after a couple of seconds, a new window; Warning Currently, running experiments when PsychoPy is full screen doesn't (always) work... So make sure it's not full screen when you run the demo (or any experiment, really). After the experiment has finished, the experiment window closes automatically. In the Experiment runner , you see some information about the experiment (but nothing super interesting); you may close the Experiment runner for now. Tip Want to quit an experiment before it has finished? Press the escape key! In most experiments, this will abort the experiment. Experiment settings (Builder only) When you are using the Builder interface, you can set several global settings in the Experimental settings window. To open this window, click on the gear icon ( \u2699 ). In the various tabs, you can edit the experiment's settings. For example, under the \"Basic\" tab, you can edit the \"info dialog\": a pop-up that asks the participant for some information. Which information is asked can be changed at the \"Experimental info\" line. ToDo Enable the info dialog by clicking the checkbox next to \"Show info dialog\" and add a new field, \"age\", to the info dialog (without a default value). Then, run the demo experiment again (press the escape key to quit). Just before the experiment window opens, you should see the info dialog pop-up! Under the \"Data\" tab, there are various options to fine-tune how you want your experimental data to be saved. Next to \"Data filename\", you can specify the filename of the datafiles that will be saved. By default, a new directory, data , is created in which the files will be saved. In our demo experiment, we furthermore specified that the filename should be sub-%s_%s' , in which the format specifiers ( %s ) are replaced by the participant identifier ( expInfo['participant'] ) and experiment name ( expInfo['expName'] ). Here, expInfo , refers to a Python variable (a dictionary) that represents the info dialog pop-up (plus some additional information). This way, you can customize your output filenames according to the information provided by the participant! ToDo (optional) Assuming you added the \"age\" field to the info dialog earlier, try to add the participant's age to the output filename such that if, for example, participant 01 who is 29 years old does the experiment, the output filename will be sub-01_age-29_intropy_demo (+ extension). If you're feeling adventurous, try using F-strings instead of format specifiers! In addition to the mandatory \"psydat\" file (which we personally never used), you can also have Psychopy save an extensive log file and CSV files. We recommend always saving the log and the \"trial-by-trial\" CSV files. Under the \"Audio\" tab, you can specify which soundlibrary Psychopy should use. Currently, Psychopy advises to use the Psychtoolbox (ptb) soundlibrary. The \"Online\" tab contains various settings to export your experiment to a format that can be used online (only applicable to Builder experiments), but this is beyond the scope of this course. Finally, the \"Screen\" tab contains several important settings that specify the experiment window. The \"Screen\" option (default: 1), for example, specifies on which screen the experiment should run in case of multiple monitor set-ups. You can also choose to run the experiment full screen (the default) or whether to specify a particular window size (in pixels) and the color and colorspace of the window (\"Color\" and \"Color space\"). Another important setting is the \"Units\" that Psychopy should use. ToDo Please read the excellent explanation of the different settings for the \"Units\" on the PsychoPy website . To see the effect of a different unit for size, change \"Units\" from \"height\" to, e.g., \"pixels\" and run the demo experiment again. Monitors Another important element of each experiment, both in the Coder and Builder interface, is the monitor that it is displayed on. In Psychopy's \"Monitor Center\", you can specify several properties of the monitor(s) that you intend to use for your experiment. Although it is not strictly necessary to specify a monitor for your experiment, it is a prerequisite for some \"Units\" settings (such as degree visual angle )! If possible, we recommend always specifying a monitor. To open the Monitor Center, click on the monitor icon ( \ud83d\udda5 ). You should see the monitor testMonitor , which is, as the notes say, a \"default (not very useful) monitor.\" To create a new monitor, click New and give your new monitor a name (e.g., \"laptop\"). Then, you can specify several properties of your monitor. For example, you can specify the number of pixels of your monitor (e.g., 1920\u00d71080 for a full HD screen), which is important if you use the \"pixel\" setting under \"Units\". You can also set the screen distance, i.e., how far participants are seated from the monitor (important when stimuli are specified in degrees visual angle ) and the screen width. ToDo Create a new monitor specific to your own laptop/desktop monitor. Fill in your current screen distance, screen size, and screen width. When you're done, click Save . Set in the Experiment settings the \"Units\" to \"deg\" (visual degree angle) and run the demo experiment. Then, change the screen distance to 200 cm and run the demo experiment again. You should see that the size of the stimuli appears smaller on the screen. Alright, by now you know your way around PsychoPy, so you're ready to start with the Builder interface !","title":"Introduction to PsychoPy"},{"location":"intro_psychopy/#introduction-to-psychopy","text":"PsychoPy is currently the most used and complete Python package to create experiments.

This project includes several nifty tools to make programming a little easier! Jupyterhub One tool that we use in this course is \"Jupyterhub\". This piece of software allows you to easily create a preconfigured Python environment on an external server \u2014 no need to install Python on your own computer anymore! You just go to the website/public IP associated with the external server and you can start programming! We run Jupyterlab on our own server at the University of Amsterdam, which Research Master students can use for this course. Others may use the aforementioned tool \"Binder\" to create a Jupyterhub instance themselves, which can be used for this course as well! Jupyterlab Another tool we use is \"Jupyterlab\", which is an extensive integrated development environment (IDE) similar to RStudio. Because it is implemented in the browser, it combines well with Jupyterhub (but it can also be used on your own computer). Using the Jupyterlab interface, you can create text files and (Python) scripts, open interactive Python consoles, open terminals, and run so-called Jupyter notebooks (for more info, check the documentation ). Don't worry if this doesn't make sense to you at this point! We will explain the most important functionality step-by-step during the course. If you want to see how Jupyterlab looks like, click one of the two buttons below, which will launch a Jupyterhub instance with a Jupyterlab interface that includes the course materials. The UvA Jupyterhub is only accessible to Research Master Students enrolled in the \"Programming for Psychology\" course. Note that, instead of using the Jupyterlab interface, you can also use the \"classic\" interface, which is less extensive but also \"cleaner\". To do so, click on Help \u2192 Launch Classic Notebook or change the word lab to the word tree in the URL. To change back from the classic interface to the Jupyterlab interface, change the word lab back to tree in the URL. Info If you have installed Python on your own computer, you can start the Jupyterlab interface by clicking on the JupyterLab icon in Anaconda Navigator (Mac/Windows) or running the following command in your terminal (Mac/Linux) or Anaconda prompt (Windows): jupyter lab Jupyter notebooks Finally, we use \"Jupyter notebooks\" a lot in this course. Jupyter notebooks are very similar to R Markdown files. Like R Markdown files, you can mix text, code, plots, and mathematical formulas within a single document. Most of our tutorials are actually written in Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks are great for \"interactive programming\", in which it is easy to experiment, try out, and troubleshoot your code. Because this mode of programming is great for teaching, we will use Jupyter notebooks a lot in week 1. Interactive programing is not, however, the only way in which you use Python. In fact, a lot of people use Python in a non-interactive way by writing scripts. In this \"script mode\" (for lack of a better term), writing the code and running the code are done separately. The code interface of Psychopy, for example, cannot be used interactively and only supports \"script mode\". We will dicuss both \"modes\" in this course. If you want to check out Jupyter notebooks already, open Jupyterlab (using Binder, on the UvA server, or on your own computer) and click in the launcher on the \"Python 3\" tile under the \"Notebook\" header, which will open a new Jupyter notebook!

Because it is implemented in the browser, it combines well with Jupyterhub (but it can also be used on your own computer). Using the Jupyterlab interface, you can create text files and (Python) scripts, open interactive Python consoles, open terminals, and run so-called Jupyter notebooks (for more info, check the documentation ). Don't worry if this doesn't make sense to you at this point! We will explain the most important functionality step-by-step during the course. If you want to see how Jupyterlab looks like, click one of the two buttons below, which will launch a Jupyterhub instance with a Jupyterlab interface that includes the course materials. The UvA Jupyterhub is only accessible to Research Master Students enrolled in the \"Programming for Psychology\" course. Note that, instead of using the Jupyterlab interface, you can also use the \"classic\" interface, which is less extensive but also \"cleaner\". To do so, click on Help \u2192 Launch Classic Notebook or change the word lab to the word tree in the URL. To change back from the classic interface to the Jupyterlab interface, change the word lab back to tree in the URL.

Jupyter notebooks are very similar to R Markdown files. Like R Markdown files, you can mix text, code, plots, and mathematical formulas within a single document. Most of our tutorials are actually written in Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks are great for \"interactive programming\", in which it is easy to experiment, try out, and troubleshoot your code. Because this mode of programming is great for teaching, we will use Jupyter notebooks a lot in week 1. Interactive programing is not, however, the only way in which you use Python. In fact, a lot of people use Python in a non-interactive way by writing scripts. In this \"script mode\" (for lack of a better term), writing the code and running the code are done separately. The code interface of Psychopy, for example, cannot be used interactively and only supports \"script mode\". We will dicuss both \"modes\" in this course. If you want to check out Jupyter notebooks already, open Jupyterlab (using Binder, on the UvA server, or on your own computer) and click in the launcher on the \"Python 3\" tile under the \"Notebook\" header, which will open a new Jupyter notebook!

We will explain the basic elements of the Builder interface so that, in the next tutorial, we can focus more on the implementational details. You might think, \"Why learn how to use a graphical interface in a programming course?\" The reason we first teach you how to use the Builder interface is because it allows us to focus on the structure of experiments before elaborating on the underlying code. Another advantage of Builder experiments is that they can be used online! (But this is beyond the scope of this course.) ToDo Read this page which discusses the respective advantages of the Builder and Coder interface in more detail. Builder vs. coder As discussed before, the Builder and Coder interfaces can both be used to create experiments. Whereas the Builder allows you create experiments graphically, the Coder allows you to program your experiment directly in Python. It is important to realize, though, that when PsychoPy runs Builder experiments, it actually first generates (or \"compiles\") the experiment as a Python file (as if you created it using the Coder)! ToDo Let's see this Builder-to-Coder compilation in action. If you haven't loaded the demo Builder experiment ( intropy_demo.psyexp ), do so now. Then, click the Compile to script button (right of the Edit experiment settings button). This should open the Coder interface with the code equivalent of the demo Builder experiment! The generated intropy_demo.py script contains the code necessary to run the experiment originally specified in the Builder interface (i.e., in the intropy_demo.psyexp file). In fact, everytime your run a Builder experiment on your own computer, Psychopy first generates the corresponding Python script, which is then executed to start the experiment. Most of the time, you can ignore the script associated with your Builder experiment. It may, however, give you some insight about what is going on \"under the hood\". Take a look at the generated script; do you see elements from the demo experiment (e.g., the text or images shown during the demo experiment)? Elements of the Builder interface Now, let's take a look at the elements of the Builder interface. Make sure you (still) have the demo experiment active in the Builder. Apart from the list of icons on top of the Builder window, there are several subwindows (or panes): the Routines pane, the Components pane, and the Flow pane. We'll discuss these in turn. The routines pane The Routines pane consist of the different elements of your experiment, where each element gets its own tab. In the demo experiment, for example, there are four routines: intro , show_stimulus , gabor , and wrap_up . Each routine may consist of multiple components (e.g., text, images, and sounds). For example, if you click on the intro routine tab, the routine pane shows, across different \"rows\", that this routine consists of three consecutive text components ( hello , welcome , and wait_key ) and a \"keyboard\" component ( key_resp ). Moreover, the routine pane also shows you the onset and offsets of the different components. Note that routines do not have to contain multiple components; for example, the show_stimulus routine only contains a single component (i.e., stim ). It's up to you how you how you structure your routines! ToThink In the intro routine, the wait_key and key_resp components seem to lack an explicit offset. Considering the demo experiment, do you understand why? The components pane The components pane contains, as you might have guessed, the different components you can include in your routines. Some of the most used components are listed under favorites (such as text and image components). The stimuli section contains various different stimulus components you might want to use in your experiment, such as dot stimuli , gratings , and sounds . The responses section contains several components that facilitate interaction with the participant. For example, the mouse component allows you to record and use mouse movements and clicks and the rating scale component creates a rating scale which you can use to collect ratings on, for example, questionnaire items. By clicking on a particular component, a pop-up appears in which you can set the properties of the component, such as the component name, onset and and duration, and several component-specific properties. For example, if you click on a text component, you can set the color, font, font size (\"letter height\"), position, and of course the text itself. Tip In the properties window, if you hover your cursor over the different options, you see a little window with an explanation of that option! Also, the PsychoPy documentation contains detailed information about each component. The easiest way to find the appropriate page is, in my experience, just googling \"psychopy component {component name}\". ToDo Try finding the documentation page for the image component! In the properties window, if you click the \"OK\" button, PsychoPy will add this component to the currently active routine. If you want, you can still change the properties afterwards. We will discuss setting component properties in more detail in the next tutorial! ToDo (optional) Try adding another text component with the text \"The end!\" to the wrap_up routine. Make sure it immediately starts after the goodbye component and it lasts one second. Run the experiment to see whether it worked! The flow pane Finally, the flow pane shows and defines the order of your experiment's routines. In the demo experiment, for example, the flow pane shows that the experiment starts with the intro routine, followed by the show_stimulus routine, and finally the gabor and wrap_up routines. The colors of the routines in the flow pane indicate whether the routines has a known and exact duration (green) or not (blue or red). For experiments in which precision of onsets/offsets is not crucial, this is not really important. But in experiments in which you want to be sure your routines' onsets, offsets, and durations are precise (i.e., non-slip timing in PsychoPy lingo), such as in neuroimaging experiments, you want to make sure each routine is green. ToThink Do you understand why the intro routine is blue instead of green? Hint: the answer to this question is the same as to the previous ToThink . ToDo (optional) Try inserting a new routine at the end of the experiment flow (i.e., after the goodbye routine). For example, create a new routine called the_end (in the top menu: Experiment \u2192 New routine ) with a single text component lasting 1 second. Then, to insert it in the experiment flow, click on Insert Routine , select your new routine, and click on the flow line in between wrap_up and the arrow head to insert it! Anothing think you might encounter in the flow pane is \"loops\", like the stimulus_loop in the demo experiment. This functionality allows you to, well, add loops across routines! In the demo experiment, we use this to repeat our show_stimulus routine for the three different images. This is, of course, much more efficient than creating three different routines (or, equivalently, a single routine with three image components)!

In this tutorial, we will guide you through creating a \"Stroop task\", step by step. If you are not familiar with the Stroop task, check out the video below! Using the Builder interface, we are going to create a simple color-word Stroop experiment, including instructions. Along the way, we explain several PsychoPy features, which you will practice with in ToDos . A finished Stroop experiment is availabel under solutions/week_2/stroop.psyexp , but we highly recommend that you first try to complete the exercises without peaking at the solution! Warning Make sure you save your experiment ( File \u2192 Save , or cmd/ctrl + s ) often during this tutorial! Create a new experiment Let's start by creating a new experiment. ToDo Create a new experiment ( File \u2192 New ) and immediately save the experiment with the name stroop.psyexp in the tutorials/week_2 folder. Also, let's change some of the default settings. ToDo In the Experiment settings window ( Basic tab), enter stroop next to Experiment name and remove the session option in the Experiment info box. In the Data tab, make sure the data is saved as sub-{nr} . Finally, in the Screen tab, make sure the experiment uses your own monitor (which you created in an earlier tutorial) and set the Units to \"norm\". Note that the choice of normalized units (\"norm\") is somewhat arbitrary. We personally like it to easily create stimuli with the appropriate size (but YMMV). Welcome Let's start our experiment with a nice welcome to our participants who are willing to participate in our experiment. To do so, we'll create a new routine with a single text component. Note that new experiments contain, by default, a single routine named trial . ToDo We'll use the default trial routine, but let's rename it to welcome . In the flow pane, right-click the trial routine, select rename , and change its name to welcome . Then, in the components pane, select a text component. After clicking on the text component icon, the previously discussed properties window pops up. This window has different tabs, but most often you only change things in the Basic tab (and sometimes in the Advanced tab). First of all, although PsychoPy provides a default component name (here: \"text\"), we recommend you choose a descriptive name of the new component. ToDo Give the component a new, descriptive name in the Name field (e.g., welcome_txt ). Then, the next thing to determine is the start (onset) and stop (offset) of the component relative to the start of the current routine. For both the start and the stop times of your component, you can choose whether to define these times in seconds \u2014 time (s) in the dropdown menu \u2014 or in the number of frames \u2014 frame N in the dropdown menu. We will revisit timing in terms of the number of frames in the Coder tutorials later; for now, we will use the time (s) option (for more info about the frame N and condition options, check the PsychoPy website ). In addition to the seconds/frames option, the stop time can also be defined in terms of the component's duration (which is, in fact, the default). When the start time is 0, then the duration (s) and time (s) give the same results, of course. ToDo Set the component onset to 0 and the duration to 3 seconds. Other options include the color and font of the text component. The Color field accepts any standard X11 color names and you can use any font available on your system. For now, let's leave these options to their defaults ( white and Arial ). The next property is the size (or Letter height ) of the text. The units of the font size are whatever you specified in the Experiment settings ! As we specified normalized units, the default ( 0.1 ) represents 10% of the half the the screen. Then, you can specify the position of text component with two numbers: x (the horizontal position) and y (the vertical position). Like the letter height, the units depend on whatever you specified in the Experiment settings . ToDo Let's make this a little bigger. Set the letter height to 0.2. Then (for now specific reason whatsover), set the position such that the text will appear horizontally in the middle, but vertically halfway between the top and the middle. Make sure you have read the explanation of normalized units on the PsychoPy website before you try to do this! Finally, the only thing we need to specify is, of course, the text itself! In the Text box, you may specify any plain text, including line breaks (\"enters\"). Note that PsychoPy will automatically try to wrap the text if it exceeds the window (which can be customized with the Wrap width option in the Advanced tab). ToDo Add some text to the text component to welcome our participant. When you're done, click OK to save all the changes to the properties. By now, you should see the new text component in both the routines pane (with its onset/offset) and in the flow pane. Try running the experiment by clicking on the green play button (\u25ba) to check whether everything works as expected! If the Experiment runner displays ##### Experiment ended. ##### , everything ran without problems. Tip Each Builder component has a Help button in the lower left corner of the properties window. If you click this button, your browser will open the PsychoPy documentation of the associated component! Instructions After welcoming our participants, let's give them some general instructions about our task. As a side note, we want to stress that spending some time and effort to create clear and extensive instructions can, in our experience, matter a lot for the quality of your data! Here, we'll keep it short, but keep this in mind for your future experiments. ToDo Add a new routine ( Experiment \u2192 New Routine ) and name it instructions . After doing so, you should see that an empty routine appears in the routine pane. Also, note that PsychoPy does not automatically add your new routine to the flow pane (after all, it doesn't know where you want this routine to appear). To do so, click on Insert Routine in the flow pane, select the instructions routine, and click on the flow in between the welcome routine and the right arrow head. ToDo Add the instructions routine to the flow right after the welcome routine. Now, we need another text component with instructions of course, but this time we are going to implement it slightly differently than we did in the welcome routine. We want to make sure our participants have enough time to read the instructions, so setting a predefined duration (like we did in the welcome routine) is not ideal. Instead, we will let the participant indicate whenever they are done and want to continue by having them press the return (\"enter\") key. But first, we need a text component with some instructions. ToDo Add a text component with the following text: In this experiment, you will see words (either \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cred\u201d) in different colors (also either \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cred\u201d). Importantly, you need to respond to the COLOR of the word and you need to ignore the actual word. (Press \u2018enter\u2019 to start the experiment!) Give the component a sensible name, keep the letter height at the default (0.1), and leave the \"stop\" property empty. The effect of leaving the \"stop\" property empty is that you, technically, create a component with an infinite duration. This is highlighted in the routine pane by the bar corresponding to the component extending beyond the time axis. As mentioned, we'd like to continue the experiment if the participant pressed the return key. To implement this, we'll need to add a keyboard component . In addition to some standard properties (like name , start , and stop ), the keyboard component also has the property Allowed keys , which specifies which keys are recorded and affect this component, and Store , which specifies which of the potentially multiple key presses should be saved. The property Store correct is not relevant, here, so we'll ignore that for now. Another important property, especially in our current use case, is the Force end of Routine option. When enabled (the default), it will end the current routine and move on to the next whenever one of the allowed keys is pressed, which is exactly what we want for our instruction routine! ToDo Add a keyboard component to the instruction routine. Make sure the stop property is left empty and that it ends the routine when the participant presses the return key (i.e., use \"return\" for Allowed keys ). If you did the ToDo correctly, you should see a new keyboard component in the instruction routine which similarly extends beyond the time axis of the routine pane (indicating that it does not have an offset). Now, run the experiment again and check whether the instruction routine works as expected! (Note: because the instruction routine is the experiment's last routine, it may seem that the experiment doesn't advance immediately after pressing enter, but that's because it takes a second or two to quit the experiment after the last routine due to saving data and such.) If this were a real experiment for your master thesis, for example, we'd recommend adding some more detailed instructions and practice trials, but our current instructions suffice for now. Fixation target Often, experiments contain a \"fixation target\" before and in between trials to prevent participants from making too many eyemovements which may impact the results. Often, a simple plus sign is used (which can be created using a text component). For educational purposes, however, let's use a small circle (\"fixation dot\"), which can be created using the Polygon component. ToDo Create a new routine, named init_fix , with a single Polygon component representing a white circle of size (0.01, 0.01) lasting 2 seconds. Note: \"circle\" is not part of the standard polygon shapes you can choose. Read the documentation carefully to figure out how to create a circle! After creating the init_fix routine, run the experiment to see whether it works as expected! ToThink If you run the experiment, the fixation dot may look more like an oval than a circle... Do you understand why? Do you know how to fix this?Hint: it has to do with the experiment's units. If you want a challenge, try the (optional) ToDo below. ToDo In their article What is the best fixation target? The effect of target shape on stability of fixational eye movements , Thaler and colleagues (2013) investigate the effect of different fixation targets on eye movements and find that the fixation target below leads to the fewest eye movements. Try creating this \"optimal fixation target\" instead of the circle from the previous ToDo. Note that you need multiple Polygon components in the same routine to achieve this.

Here, we'll keep it short, but keep this in mind for your future experiments. ToDo Add a new routine ( Experiment \u2192 New Routine ) and name it instructions . After doing so, you should see that an empty routine appears in the routine pane. Also, note that PsychoPy does not automatically add your new routine to the flow pane (after all, it doesn't know where you want this routine to appear). To do so, click on Insert Routine in the flow pane, select the instructions routine, and click on the flow in between the welcome routine and the right arrow head. ToDo Add the instructions routine to the flow right after the welcome routine. Now, we need another text component with instructions of course, but this time we are going to implement it slightly differently than we did in the welcome routine. We want to make sure our participants have enough time to read the instructions, so setting a predefined duration (like we did in the welcome routine) is not ideal. Instead, we will let the participant indicate whenever they are done and want to continue by having them press the return (\"enter\") key. But first, we need a text component with some instructions. ToDo Add a text component with the following text: In this experiment, you will see words (either \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cred\u201d) in different colors (also either \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cred\u201d). Importantly, you need to respond to the COLOR of the word and you need to ignore the actual word. (Press \u2018enter\u2019 to start the experiment!) Give the component a sensible name, keep the letter height at the default (0.1), and leave the \"stop\" property empty. The effect of leaving the \"stop\" property empty is that you, technically, create a component with an infinite duration. This is highlighted in the routine pane by the bar corresponding to the component extending beyond the time axis. As mentioned, we'd like to continue the experiment if the participant pressed the return key. To implement this, we'll need to add a keyboard component . In addition to some standard properties (like name , start , and stop ), the keyboard component also has the property Allowed keys , which specifies which keys are recorded and affect this component, and Store , which specifies which of the potentially multiple key presses should be saved. The property Store correct is not relevant, here, so we'll ignore that for now. Another important property, especially in our current use case, is the Force end of Routine option. When enabled (the default), it will end the current routine and move on to the next whenever one of the allowed keys is pressed, which is exactly what we want for our instruction routine! ToDo Add a keyboard component to the instruction routine. Make sure the stop property is left empty and that it ends the routine when the participant presses the return key (i.e., use \"return\" for Allowed keys ). If you did the ToDo correctly, you should see a new keyboard component in the instruction routine which similarly extends beyond the time axis of the routine pane (indicating that it does not have an offset). Now, run the experiment again and check whether the instruction routine works as expected! (Note: because the instruction routine is the experiment's last routine, it may seem that the experiment doesn't advance immediately after pressing enter, but that's because it takes a second or two to quit the experiment after the last routine due to saving data and such.) If this were a real experiment for your master thesis, for example, we'd recommend adding some more detailed instructions and practice trials, but our current instructions suffice for now.","title":"Instructions"},{"location":"psychopy_builder_part2_stroop/#fixation-target","text":"Often, experiments contain a \"fixation target\" before and in between trials to prevent participants from making too many eyemovements which may impact the results. Often, a simple plus sign is used (which can be created using a text component). For educational purposes, however, let's use a small circle (\"fixation dot\"), which can be created using the Polygon component. ToDo Create a new routine, named init_fix , with a single Polygon component representing a white circle of size (0.01, 0.01) lasting 2 seconds. Note: \"circle\" is not part of the standard polygon shapes you can choose. Read the documentation carefully to figure out how to create a circle! After creating the init_fix routine, run the experiment to see whether it works as expected! ToThink If you run the experiment, the fixation dot may look more like an oval than a circle... Do you understand why? Do you know how to fix this?Hint: it has to do with the experiment's units. If you want a challenge, try the (optional) ToDo below. ToDo In their article What is the best fixation target? The effect of target shape on stability of fixational eye movements , Thaler and colleagues (2013) investigate the effect of different fixation targets on eye movements and find that the fixation target below leads to the fewest eye movements. Try creating this \"optimal fixation target\" instead of the circle from the previous ToDo. Note that you need multiple Polygon components in the same routine to achieve this.","title":"Fixation target"},{"location":"psychopy_builder_part2_stroop/#trial-loop","text":"Stuff about conditions file.","title":"Trial loop"},{"location":"psychopy_builder_part2_stroop/#code-components-optional","text":"Add random ISI using random module.
